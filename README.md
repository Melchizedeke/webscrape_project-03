# My Own Personal Websraping Project (End to End)

After learning to do webscrapping from at least two tutorial videos, I have grown fond of the whole process. So I decided to create something of my own wihtout any video assistance.

# About Project

In this project, I am going to scrape a book site [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.com/collections/mc/first-editions/53jKjLpLq5krU0qFS5tvnO?cm_sp=ccbrowse-_-p0-_-collections), and save the following key data from it,

- Title : the title of the book
- Author : the name of the author of the book
- Pub_Year : year of book's publication
- Price : Price of the book in dolllars.

After this scraping, I hope to save the copied data into a `.csv` file, I hope to do a little analysis on the saved data subsequently hopefully.

The basics libraries I will be using are:

- `BeautifulSoup from bs4`
- `request`
- `csv`

I hope to import other libraries as I feel the need to add more functionalities to the code. I am super excited about this.

Still having issues with the price variable
